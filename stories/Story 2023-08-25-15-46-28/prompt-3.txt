Image Prompt: Suspended high above the city, Matt clings to the edge of a monorail track, his white-knuckled hands gripping the cold metal.

The wind whips through his brown hair, strands of it sticking to his determined face. (ImagePrompt: In the style of Brian Froud, known for his whimsical illustrations, depict Matt's perilous position on the monorail track with a vibrant and mythical touch.)
